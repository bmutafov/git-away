A script that allows you to clean your merged (and non-merged) branches in a repository interactively.

## Running

### Run immediately

The simplest way is via `npx` if you have NodeJS installed on your machine. Simply open a terminal and type:

```
npx git-away
```

### Install

You can also install globally

```
npm install -g git-away
```

and then use it without npx:

```
git-away
```
